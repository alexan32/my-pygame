- dynamic camera. can be set to follow, stationary, jump around map?
- environment objects: walls, doors, traps, chests, collectables.
- create a level and file system. (can use JSON to store levels/object data?)

short term objectives:
- review collision detection. implement hitbox offset? multiple hitboxes per game objects? move collision handling to hitbox class?
- implement sprite system for gameObjects. sprite controller object with state system? look at pygame sprites
- environment variables for graphics settings?

- implement sprite system
